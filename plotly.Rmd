## Analysis of car dataset

In this chart we show the mpg by number of cylinders.

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))

plot_ly(mtcars, y = ~mpg, color = ~as.factor(cyl), type = "box") %>%
    layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Number of cylinders"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Miles/(US) gallon")
    )
```
